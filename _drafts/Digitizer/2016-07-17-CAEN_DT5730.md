## Acquisition Modes

### Channel calibration

In order to achieve best performance, a self channel calibration procedure should be run after the ADCs have stabilized their operating temperature. Whenever the operating temperature changes significantly, a new calibration procedure should be performed. The ADCs temperature can be read at the Channel n Temperature Monitor register.

The calibration is performed through the Channel Calibration register:

- Write whatever value in the Channel Calibration register: the self calibration process will start simultaneously on each channel of the board and the "Calibrating bit" flag of Channel n Status register will be set to 0.
- Poll the "Calibrating bit" flag until it returns to 1.

It is recommended to wait for few seconds before a new RUN, to let the calibration get stabilized.

### Acquisition Run/Stop
The acquisition can be started and stopped in different ways, according to bits[1:0] setting of Acquisition Control register (address 0x8100) and bit[2] of the same register:

- SW CONTROLLED (bits[1:0] = 00): Start and Stop take place by software command. Bit[2] = 0 means stopped, while bit[2] = 1 means running.
- GPI CONTROLLED MODE (bits[1:0] = 01): If the acquisition is armed (i.e. bit[2] = 1), then Run starts when GPI is asserted and stops when GPI returns inactive. If bit[2] = 0, the acquisition is always off.
- FIRST TRIGGER CONTROLLED (bits[1:0] = 10): bit[2] = 1 arms the acquisition and the Start is issued on the first trigger pulse (rising edge) on the TRG-IN connector. This pulse is not used as a trigger; actual triggers start from the second pulse on TRG-IN. The Stop acquisition must be SW controlled (i.e. reset of bit[2]).

### Acquisition triggering: Samples & Events

When the acquisition is running, a trigger signal allows to:

- Store the 31-bit counter value of the Trigger Time Tag (TTT). The counter (representing a time reference), like so the Trigger Logic Unit (see **Fig. 9.2**) operates at a frequency of 125 MHz (i.e. 8 ns, that is to say 4 ADC clock cycles). Due to the way the acquired data are written into the board internal memory (i.e. in 4-sample bunches), the TTT counter is read every 2 trigger logic clock cycles, which means the trigger time stamp resolution results in 16 ns (i.e. 62.5 MHz). Basing on that, the LSB of the TTT is always “0”;
- Increment the EVENT COUNTER.
- Fill the active buffer with the pre/post-trigger samples, whose number is programmable (Acquisition window width), freezing then the buffer for readout purposes, while acquisition continues on another buffer.

An event is therefore composed by the trigger time tag, pre- and post-trigger samples and the event counter.

Overlap between “acquisition windows” may occur (a new trigger occurs while the board is still storing the samples related to the previous trigger); this overlap can be either rejected or accepted (programmable via software).

If the board is programmed to accept the overlapped triggers, as the “overlapping” trigger arrives, the current active buffer is filled up, then the samples storage continues on the subsequent one. In this case events will not have all the same size (see **Fig. 9.3** below)

![Trigger overlap](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_TriggerOverlap_93.png)

A trigger can be refused for the following causes:

- Acquisition is not active.
- Memory is FULL and therefore there are no available buffers.
- The required number of samples for building the pre-trigger of the event is not reached yet; this happens typically as the trigger occurs too early either with respect to the RUN Acquisition command (see § **Acquisition Run/Stop**) or with respect to a buffer emptying after a Memory FULL status (see § **Acquisition Synchronization**).
- The trigger overlaps the previous one and the board is not enabled for accepting overlapped triggers.

As a trigger is refused, the current buffer is not frozen and the acquisition continues writing on it. The EVENT COUNTER can be programmed in order to be either incremented or not. If this function is enabled, the EVENT COUNTER value identifies the number of the triggers sent (but the event number sequence is lost); if the function is not enabled, the EVENT COUNTER value coincides with the sequence of buffers saved and readout.

### Multi-Event Memory Organization

Each channel of the DT5730 features a SRAM memory to store the acquired events. The memory size for the event storage is 640 kS/ch or 5.12 MS/s and it can be divided in a programmable number, Nb , of buffers (Nb from 1 up to 1024) by the Buffer Organization register (address 0x800C) as described in **Tab. 9.1** below.

![Buffer Organization](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_BufferOrganization_91.png)

Having 640 kS memory size as reference, this means that each buffer contains 640k/Nb samples (e.g. Nb = 1024 means 640 samples in each buffer).

IMPORTANT: For AMC FPGA firmware release < 0.2, the Size of one Buffer related to each Buffer Number must be intended as the number of the samples in **Tab. 9.1**. without decreasing by 10 samples.

### Custom sized events

In case an event size minor than the buffer size is needed, the user can set the value $N_{LOC}$ of the Custom Size register; the event is so forced to be made by $10 * N_{LOC}$ samples. Setting $N_{LOC} = 0$ , the custom size is disabled. The value of $N_{LOC}$ must be set in order that the relevant number of samples does not exceed the buffer size and it mustn’t be modified while the acquisition is running.

Note: Even using the custom size setting, the number of buffers and the buffer size are not affected by $N_{LOC}$ , but they are still determined by Nb .

### Event Structure

The event can be readout via Optical Link and/or USB; data format is 32-bit long word (see **Tab. 9.2**)

An event is structured in:

- Header (four 32-bit words)
- Data (variable size and format)

Header is made by 4 words including the following information:

- EVENT SIZE = size of the event (number of 32-bit long words)
- Bit[26] (2 nd header word) = Board Fail flag. This bit is set to “1” in consequence of a hardware problem (e.g. PLL unlocking or over-temperature condition). The user can investigate the problem by the available status registers or contact CAEN Support Service.
- CH MASK = channels participating in the event building. This information must be used by the software to acknowledge which channel the samples are coming from.
- EVENT COUNTER = the trigger counter; it can count either accepted triggers only, or all triggers.
- TRIGGER TIME TAG = 31-bit counter (31 bit count + 1 bit as roll over flag), which is reset either as the acquisition starts or via front panel signal on GPI connector, and is incremented every 4 ADC clock cycles. It represents the trigger time reference. The TTT resolution is 16 ns and ranges up to 17 s (i.e. $8 ns*(2^{31} -1)$).

Data are the samples from the enabled channels. Data from masked channels are not read.

### Event Format Example

**Tab. 9.2** shows the event data format of DT5730 when all the 8 channels are enabled. The structure is described in § **Event Structure**.

## Acquisition Synchronization

Each channel of the digitizer is provided with a SRAM memory that can be organized in a programmable number Nb of circular buffers (Nb = [1:1024], see **Tab. 9.1**). When the trigger occurs, the FPGA writes further a programmable number of samples for the post-trigger and freezes the buffer, so that the stored data can be read via USB or Optical Link. The acquisition can continue without dead-time in a new buffer.

When all buffers are filled, the board is considered FULL: no trigger is accepted and the acquisition stops (i.e. the samples coming from the ADC are not written into the memory, so they are lost). As soon as at least one buffer is readout, the board exits the FULL condition and acquisition restarts.

Note: When the acquisition restarts, no trigger is accepted until at least the entire buffer is written. This means that the dead time is extended for a certain time (depending on the size of the acquisition window) after the board exits the FULL condition.

A way to eliminate this extra dead time is by setting bit[5] = 1 in the Acquisition Control register. The board is so programmed to enter the FULL condition when N-1 buffers are written: no trigger is then accepted, but samples writing continues in the last available buffer. As soon as one buffer is readout and becomes free, the boards exits the FULL condition and can immediately accept a new trigger. This way, the FULL reflects the BUSY condition of the board (i.e. inability to accept triggers); if required, the BUSY signal can be provided out on the digitizer front panel through the GPO LEMO connector (bits[19:18] and bits[17:16] of the Front Panel I/O Control register; address 0x811C).

Note: when bit[5] = 1, the minimum number of circular buffers to be programmed is N = 2.

In some cases, the BUSY propagation from the digitizer to other parts of the system has some latency and it can happen that one or more triggers occur while the digitizer is already FULL and unable to accept those triggers. This condition causes event loss and it is particularly unsuitable when there are multiple digitizers running synchronously, because the triggers accepted by one board and not by other boards cause event misalignment.

In this cases, it is possible to program the BUSY signal to be asserted when the digitizer is close to FULL condition, but it has still some free buffers (Almost FULL condition). In this mode, the digitizer remains able to accept some more triggers even after the BUSY assertion and the system can tolerate a delay in the inhibit of the trigger generation.

When the Almost FULL condition is enabled by setting the Almost FULL level (Memory Almost FULL Level register, address 0x816C) to X, the BUSY signal is asserted as soon as X buffers are filled, although the board still goes FULL (and rejects triggers) when the number of filled buffers is N or N-1, depending on bit[5] in the Acquisition Control register as described above.



## Trigger Management

According to the standard firmware operating, all the channels in a board share the same trigger (board common trigger), that is to say they acquire an event simultaneously and in the same way (a determined number of samples and position with respect to the trigger).

The generation of a common acquisition trigger is based on different trigger sources (configurable through the Trigger Source Enable Mask register):

- Software trigger
- External trigger
- Self-trigger
- Coincidence

### Software Trigger

Software triggers are internally produced via a software command (write access in the Software Trigger register) through USB or Optical Link.

### External Trigger

A TTL or NIM external signal can be provided in the front panel TRG-IN connector (configurable through the Front Panel I/O Control register). If the external trigger is not synchronized with the internal clock, a 1-clock period jitter occurs.

### Self-Trigger
Each channel is able to generate a self-trigger signal when the digitized input pulse exceeds a configurable threshold(Channel n Threshold register). The self-triggers of each couple of adjacent channels are then processed to provide out a single trigger request. The trigger requests are propagated to the central trigger logic where they are ORed to produce the board common trigger, which is finally distributed back to all channels causing the event acquisition. Fig. 9.5 schematizes the self-trigger and trigger request logic having the channel 0 and channel 1 couple as an example.

![Self Trigger and Trigger Request logic for Ch0 and Ch1 couple. A single trigger request signal is generated.](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_SELFTRIGGRT_95.png)


……

### Trigger Coincidence Level
Operating with the standard firmware, the acquisition trigger is a board common trigger. This common trigger allows the coincidence acquisition mode to be performed through the Majority operation.

Enabling the coincidences is possible by writing in the Trigger Source Enable Mask register (address 0x810C):

- Bits[3:0] enable the trigger request signals to participate in the coincidence;
- Bits[23:20] set the coincidence window ($T_{TVAW}$);
- Bits[26:24] set the Majority (i.e. Coincidence) level; the coincidence takes place when: **Number of enabled trigger requests > Majority level**

Supposing bits[3:0] = FF (i.e. all the 4 trigger request are enabled) and bits[26:24] = 01 (i.e. Majority level = 1), a board common trigger is issued whenever at least two of the enabled trigger requests are in coincidence within the programmed $T_{TVAW}$ .

The Majority level must be smaller than the number of trigger requests enabled via bits[3:0] mask. By default, bits[26:24] = 00 (i.e. Majority level = 0), which means the coincidence acquisition mode is disabled and the $T_{TVAW}$ is meaningless. In this case, the board common trigger is simple OR of the signals from the enabled channels pairs.

Fig. 9.8 and Fig. 9.9 show the trigger management in case the coincidences are disabled:

![Trigger request management at mezzanine level with Majority level = 0](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_MajorityLevel0_98.png)
![Trigger request management at motherboard level with Majority level = 0](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_MajorityLevel0_99.png)

Fig. 9.10 and shows the trigger management in case the coincidences are enabled with Majority level = 1 and $T_{TVAW}$ is a value different from 0. In order to simplify the description, CH1 and CH3 channels are considered disabled, so that the relevant trigger requests are the over-threshold signals from CH0 and CH1.

![Fig. 9.10: Trigger request relationship with Majority level = 1 and T TVAW ≠ 0](/img/Digitizer/CAENDT5730_MajorityLevel1_910.png)

*Note: with respect to the position where the common trigger is generated, the portion of input signal stored depends on the programmed length of the acquisition window and on the post trigger setting.*

Fig. 9.11 shows the trigger management in case the coincidences are enabled with Majority level = 1 and T TVAW = 0 (i.e. 1 clock cycle). In order to simplify the description, CH1 and CH3 channels are considered disabled, so that the relevant trigger requests are the over-threshold signals from CH0 and CH1.

### Trigger Distribution

In the default configuration, the OR of all the enabled trigger sources is synchronized with the internal clock, then becomes the common trigger of the board and is fed in parallel to all channels, which consequently provokes the capture of an event.

A Trigger Out signal is also generated on the relevant front panel GPO connector (NIM or TTL), and allows to extend the trigger signal to other boards: set bits[17:16] = 00 in Front Panel Control register and enable the desired trigger sources in Front Panel Trigger Out Enable Mask register.

For example, in order to start the acquisition on all the channels of the boards, as soon as one of the channels crosses its threshold, the relevant local trigger must be enabled as Trigger Out signal. The Trigger Out must then be fed to a Fan Out unit; the obtained signal has to be fed to the external trigger input TRG-IN of all the boards in the chain(including the board which generated the Trigger Out signal).


## Data Transfer Capabilities

DT5730 features a Multi-Event digital memory per channel, configurable by the user to be divided into 1 up to 1024 buffers, as detailed in § **Multi-Event Memory Organization**. Once they are written in the memory, the events become available for readout via USB or Optical Link. During the memory readout, the board can store other events (independently from the readout) on the available free buffers. The acquisition process is so “dead timeless” until the memory becomes full (see § **Acquisition Synchronization**).

The events are readout sequentially and completely, starting from the Header of the first available event, followed by the samples of the enabled channels (from 0 to 7) as reported in **Tab. 9.2**. Once an event is completed, the relevant memory buffer becomes free and ready to be written again (old data are lost). After the last word in an event, the first word (Header) of the subsequent event is readout. It is not possible to readout an event partially.

The size of the event (EVENT SIZE) is configurable and depends on Custom Size register setting (address 0x8020), Buffer Organization setting (address 0x800C) and the number of enabled channels.

### Block Transfers

The Block Transfer readout mode allows to read N complete events sequentially, where N is set via the Block Transfer Event Number register (address 0xEF1C) or by using the SetMaxNumEventsBLT function of the CAENDigitizer library.

When developing programs, the readout process can be implemented on different basis :

- Using Interrupts: as soon as the programmed number of events is available for readout, the board sends an interrupt to the PC over the optical communication link (not supported by USB).
- Using Polling (interrupts disabled): by performing periodic read accesses to a specific register of the board it is possible to know the number of events present in the board and perform a BLT read of the specific size to read them out.
- Using Continuous Read (interrupts disabled): continuous data read of the maximum allowed size (e.g. total memory size) is performed by the software without polling the board. The actual size of the block read is determined by the board that terminates the BLT access at the end of the data, according to the configuration of the Block Transfer Event Number register or the library function SetMaxNumEventsBLT mentioned above. If the board is empty, the BLT access is immediately terminated and the “Read Block” function will return 0 bytes (it is the ReadData function in the CAENDigitizer Library).

Whatever the method from above, it is suggested to ask the board for the maximum of the events per block being set. Furthermore, the greater this maximum, the greater the readout efficiency, despite of a greater memory allocation required on the host station side that is actually not a real drawback, considering the features of the personal computers available on the market.

### Single Data Transfer
This mode allows to readout a word per time, from the header (actually 4 words) of the first available event, followed by all the words until the end of the event, then the second event is transferred. The exact sequence of the transferred words is shown in § **Event Structure**.

It is suggested, after the 1st word is transferred, to check the EVENT SIZE information and then do as many cycles as necessary (actually EVENT SIZE -1) in order to read completely the event.
